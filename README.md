TBD 

- implement mv /renames 

- parts of multipart uploads should go into separate temp dir (to prevent end user from seeing partially uploaded objects/to maintain atomicity). If multipart-part upload fails we should clean stale parts .. This can be done asynchronously by GC thread which wil monitor temp uploads dir





### Q: what would you expect from project which "Serves files off your local HDD via S3 API "

### A: ChatGPT
1. A project that serves files off your local hard disk drive (HDD) via the Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) API would likely have the following features and characteristics:

2. Local File Access: The project should be able to access and serve files stored on your local HDD. This means it would need to have functionality to read files from the local file system.

3. S3 Compatibility: The project should implement the S3 API, allowing it to serve files in a manner that's compatible with applications and services expecting to interact with S3.

4. RESTful Interface: S3 API operates over HTTP, so the project would likely expose a RESTful interface for clients to interact with. This interface would include endpoints for operations like file retrieval, upload, deletion, and metadata management.

5. Authentication and Authorization: Like S3, the project would need mechanisms for authentication and authorization to control access to files. This could involve using AWS-style access keys and policies, or it might implement its own authentication system.

5. Error Handling and Logging: Robust error handling and logging capabilities would be necessary to ensure the reliability and security of the service. This includes handling authentication errors, file access errors, and other potential issues gracefully, while also logging relevant information for troubleshooting.

6. Scalability: While the project may initially be designed to serve files from a single local HDD, it should be architected in a way that allows it to scale horizontally if needed. This means it should be able to handle increased loads by distributing the workload across multiple instances.

7. Performance Optimization: Efficient handling of file requests is crucial for a service like this. The project should implement caching mechanisms, optimize file retrieval algorithms, and employ other techniques to ensure fast and responsive performance.

8. Security: Security measures such as encryption of data in transit and at rest, as well as protection against common security threats like injection attacks and unauthorized access, would be essential.

9. Monitoring and Metrics: The ability to monitor the health and performance of the service through metrics and logging is important for operational visibility and troubleshooting.

10. Documentation: Comprehensive documentation, including API documentation and setup/configuration instructions, would be necessary to enable users to effectively use the service.

Overall, such a project would provide a convenient way to expose files stored on a local HDD through the widely-used and versatile S3 API, allowing integration with a variety of applications and services that rely on S3-compatible storage.
